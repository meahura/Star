# Simple calculations , For mathematics and boring calculations


You can easily do the calculations you want with this library. For example, you can calculate the speed of light in a certain distance or the volume of a container of water and many other things that are included in the document.
We used Python in this library and we used libraries like time. We tried not to use many libraries to provide you with ease of access! And there is no need to install external libraries (:

But for now, we have not uploaded this package to pypi and... so that you can install it with pip, so you need to do the installation manually! So it is necessary to transfer the package file when you install the library and enjoy using it.
We did not use foreign libraries in this library either! And we did not use codes! (: And it is not necessary to install that library.

def value(value:str):
   print(star.centimeter(
      value
   ))

value(10)

# output 1000 centimeters
```

<b>3</b> - Using star library methods : Convert centimeters to meters

```python
from Star import star

def value(value:str):
   print(star.centimeter_change(
      value
   ))

value(10)

# 0.1 meters
```

<b>3</b> - Using star library methods : covid 19

```python
from Star import star

def value():
   print(star.covid_19())
value()

# Statistics of infected people in the world : 600,064,810
```
<b>4</b> - Using star library methods : They make up for the jokes we consume in a year
```python
from Star import star

def value():
   print(star.Food(10,29))
value()

#    Number of meals you eat per year (approximate) :  3650
#    Eat a few meals in your lifetime (approximate) :  105850
```

And there are many other things.
That you can see! And when you hold it, it will show its description and you can use it easily.
